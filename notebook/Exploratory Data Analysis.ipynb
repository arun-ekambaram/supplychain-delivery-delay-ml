    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "The large increase in shipping demand has not been matched by an increase in the capabilities of logistics companies.<br>\n",
    "Delayed delivery can be a risk in many sectors, one of which is retail sales in e-commerce, late delivery will cause the product supply chain to be hampered and reduce the credibility of the retailer. Apart from that, delays by the expedition will also cause buyer disappointment which of course can be detrimental to the retailer."

    "## Objectives\n",
    "1. Analyze the data and determine the target feature/binary label (is_late -> (1 or 0), according to the problem statement (delay in delivery)\n",
    "2. Carry out data processing, to produce data that is clean from noise\n",
    "3. Carrying out feature engineering, by creating new features to add data patterns which will make it easier for the model to carry out classification (so it is hoped that the accuracy will increase)\n",
    "4. Select features with high importance using feature importance techniques (Pearson Correlation Matrix, KBest, ChiSquare, and SHAP), to reduce model complexity, computational load, and improve model performance\n",
    "5. Carry out modeling using several Baseline algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, and Decision Tree), as well as advanced algorithms using Ensemble Learning (XGBoost, LGBM, CatBoost, Adaboost, and Random Forest)\n",
    "6. Evaluate the model with accuracy metrics"
